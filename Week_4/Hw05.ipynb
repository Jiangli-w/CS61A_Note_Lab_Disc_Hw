The second function will take in two arguments: message and amount. When the message passed in is 'deposit', the bank will deposit amount into the account. When the message passed in is 'withdraw', the bank will attempt to withdraw amount from the account. If the account does not have enough money for a withdrawal, the string 'Insufficient funds' will be returned. If the message passed in is neither of the two commands, the function should return 'Invalid message' Examples are shown in the doctests."

    "\n",
    "Implement a function (not a generator function) that returns the first value in the iterator `t` that appears `k` times in a row. As described in lecture, iterators can provide values using either the `next(t)` function or with a for-loop. Do not worry about cases where the function reaches the end of the iterator without finding a suitable value, all lists passed in for the tests will have a value that should be returned. If you are receiving an error where the iterator has completed then the program is not identifying the correct value. Iterate through the items such that if the same iterator is passed into `repeated` twice, it continues in the second call at the point it left off in the first. An example of this behavior is shown in the doctests."
